    <h2><div style ="background-color: cyan;">Background</div></h2>
    <p id="p1"> Welcome to my first ever website! 
        My name is Christian Kyle Dos Pueblos Napuli. 
        I am 24 years old born and raised in California. 
        I am of Filipino descent but I am a first generation born here in America.
        I am a 4th year student at CSUSB. </p>
    <br>
    <h2><div style ="background-color: rgb(102, 102, 219);">Hobbies & Interests</div></h2>
    <p id="p2"> In my free time, I like to live an active lifestyle that includes activities such as playing basketball and weightlifting.
        I embrace the standard American diet and enjoy eating at In-N-Out and Chick-Fil-A, my favorite fast food places, especially after a good workout.
        Additionally, I  give praise to Asian cuisine on occasion and enjoy eating Korean Barbeque and sushi as well.
        However, I also give homage to my Filipino heritage by eating Flipino meals such as lechon, which is roasted pig, and turon, which is fried banana.
        Suffice to say, I love rewarding a good workout by eating food with plenty of carbs and protein. 
    </p>    
    <br>
    <h2><div style ="background-color: rgb(192, 22, 192);">Plans for the future</div></h2>
    <p id="p3"> I like to compartmentalize the stages of my life. 
        That's a fancy way of saying I have tunnel vision and have not thought about my future that in depth yet.
        I am learning as I go.
        Although I have had some ideas in passing, I do not want to spend a majority of the day planning that far, as plans tend to change and usually does not go exactly as anticipated.  
        This myopia is incredibly practical and helpful in calming unnecessary anxiety, as it allows me to focus on my current lifestyle only, which is graduating with my degree in Computer Science as fast as possible.
        As for the rest of my life, I will cross that bridge when I get there, but for now I plan to take on every day one assignment and one protein bar at a time.
    </p>
